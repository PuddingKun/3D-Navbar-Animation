This HTML file creates a modern, animated landing page titled "Nature Beauty". The structure is organized into several key sections:

Navbar: At the top, thereâ€™s a navigation bar featuring a logo ("Nature Beauty") and a hamburger menu icon for mobile or interactive use.

Main Content: The centerpiece of the page is a header section containing a text overlay with a title ("Embrace the Beauty of Nature"), a descriptive paragraph, and an "Explore Nature" call-to-action button. The design encourages visitors to appreciate the serenity and harmony of the natural world.

Shadows: Two decorative divs (shadow one and shadow two) add stylish layered shadow effects for a more dynamic and artistic look.

Navigation Links: A separate links section contains a list of navigation items (Home, Services, About, Contact), each animated with individual delays using the --i CSS custom property for smooth entrance effects.

External Files:

A styles.css stylesheet (linked in the <head>) controls the visual design and animations.

An app.js script (linked at the bottom of <body>) likely handles interactivity, such as opening the hamburger menu or triggering animations.

Overall, the page is designed with a strong emphasis on visual appeal, responsiveness, and smooth animations, making it well-suited for websites related to nature, travel, wellness, or environmental themes.
